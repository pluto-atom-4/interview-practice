# 🧠 Python Interview Practice Monorepo

Welcome to your all-in-one monorepo for practicing coding interview questions in Python! This project is designed to help you master algorithms, data structures, system design, and object-oriented design — all in one place.

## ⚡️ Dependency Management with uv

This project uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for fast, modern Python dependency management. uv is a drop-in replacement for pip and pip-tools, supporting PEP 621/pyproject.toml natively.

- **Why uv?**
  - Much faster than pip
  - Handles modern Python packaging (pyproject.toml)
  - Simple install for all dependencies and dev tools

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/interview-practice.git
   cd interview-practice
   ```
2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**
   ```
   # Remove old venv if present
   rmdir /s /q venv  # Windows (run in PowerShell)
   # OR
   rm -rf venv       # macOS/Linux

   # Create new .venv using uv
   uv venv .venv
   # Activate (Windows)
   .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   # Activate (macOS/Linux)
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. **Install uv (if not already installed)**
   ```
   pip install uv
   # Or see https://github.com/astral-sh/uv for other install options
   ```
4. **Install dependencies with uv**
   ```
   uv pip install .
   # For dev dependencies (testing, Jupyter, formatting):
   uv pip install .[dev]
   ```
5. **Run tests**
   ```
   pytest
   ```

> **Note:** `requirements.txt` is now deprecated. All dependencies are managed in `pyproject.toml`.
> Jupyter and notebook tools are included as dev dependencies. Activate `.venv` before running notebooks or scripts.

## 🧹 Code Quality
This project uses **Black** and **isort** for formatting. Pre-commit hooks are configured to run automatically before each commit.
To run manually:
```
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## 🧪 How to Contribute
- Add new problems under `leetcode/` or `algorithms/`
- Write clean, well-documented code
- Add corresponding tests in `tests/`
- Format with `black` and `isort` before committing

## 📚 Resources
- (LeetCode)[https://leetcode.com/]
- (System Design Primer)[https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer]
- (Grokking the System Design Interview)[https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview]

## 🚀 Goals
- Build a strong foundation in problem-solving
- Prepare for technical interviews at top tech companies
- Track progress and improve coding fluency

Happy coding!
