Linked List Data Structure Explained Step-by-Step
-----------------------------------------------
A linked list is a linear data structure where each element (node) contains a value and a reference to the next node.

Here is how the process works:

1. **Append**: Traverse to the end and add a new node.
   - If the list is empty, make the new node the head
   - Otherwise, traverse to the last node and link it to the new node

2. **Prepend**: Insert a new node at the beginning, updating the head.
   - Create a new node and point it to the current head
   - Update the head to point to the new node

3. **Delete**: Find the node with the target value and remove it by updating references.
   - Handle special case if the head needs to be deleted
   - Otherwise, find the node before the target and update its next pointer

4. **Find**: Traverse the list to check if a value exists.
   - Start from the head and check each node's value
   - Return True if found, False if we reach the end

5. **To List**: Collect all node values into a Python list for easy viewing.
   - Traverse from head to tail, collecting values

6. **Reverse**: Reverse the linked list in-place by updating node references.
   - Start with prev as None and curr as the head
   - For each node, store the next node, set curr.next to prev, then move prev and curr forward
   - After traversal, set head to prev (the new front)

Linked lists are useful for dynamic data where insertions and deletions are frequent and efficient.

Time Complexity:
- Append/Prepend: O(n)/O(1) respectively
- Delete/Find: O(n)
- Reverse: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1) for operations, O(n) for storage

This data structure demonstrates pointer manipulation and is commonly discussed in interviews
for its simplicity and fundamental importance in computer science.
