# üîó System Design: URL Shortener

## üß≠ Overview
Design a scalable service that converts long URLs into short, shareable links ‚Äî similar to Bitly or TinyURL.

---

## üéØ Requirements

### Functional
- Shorten a long URL
- Redirect short URL to original
- Track usage (clicks, timestamps)
- Optional: custom aliases, expiration, user accounts

### Non-Functional
- High availability
- Low latency redirection
- Horizontal scalability
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention

## üß± Architecture Components

| Layer       | Component                     | Description |
|------------|-------------------------------|-------------|
| Frontend    | React / Vue / Angular         | Form to submit and retrieve URLs |
| Backend     | REST API (Node.js / Django / Spring) | Handles URL creation and redirection |
| Database    | PostgreSQL / MongoDB          | Stores mappings and metadata |
| Cache       | Redis                         | Speeds up redirection lookups |
| ID Generator| Base62 encoder or hash        | Generates short unique keys |
| Hosting     | AWS / GCP / Azure             | Scalable deployment |
| Monitoring  | Prometheus + Grafana          | Tracks performance and errors |

## üîÑ API Design

### POST `/api/shorten`
```json
{
  "longUrl": "https://example.com/very/long/url"
}
```
### GET `/abc123`

Behavior: Redirects to original long URL


## üóÉÔ∏è Database Schema (SQL)

```sql
CREATE TABLE urls (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  short_code VARCHAR(10) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  long_url TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  click_count INT DEFAULT 0
);
```

This snippet defines a simple schema for storing shortened URLs, including a unique short code, the original long URL, a timestamp, and a click counter. Let me know if you‚Äôd like to expand it with expiration dates, user IDs, or indexing strategies!

## üî¢ Short Code Generation

### Option 1: Base62 Encoding
- Encode auto-incremented ID using [A-Za-z0-9]
- Example: ID `125` ‚Üí `abc`

### Option 2: Hashing
- Hash long URL and truncate
- Handle collisions with retries or salt

## üöÄ Performance & Scalability

- **Caching**: Use Redis for short-to-long URL lookup
- **Rate Limiting**: Token bucket or IP throttling
- **Load Balancing**: NGINX or cloud-native balancer
- **Replication**: Read replicas for DB scaling
- **CDN**: Serve static assets and redirect logic globally

## üìä Analytics & Monitoring

- Track:
  - Clicks per URL
  - Referrer and geolocation
  - Time of access
- Tools:
  - Prometheus for metrics
  - Grafana for dashboards
  - ELK stack for logs

## üß™ Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for API endpoints
- Integration tests for DB and cache
- Load testing with JMeter or Locust
- Security tests for abuse and injection


## üß† Interview Tips

- Start with requirements and constraints
- Use diagrams to show data flow
- Discuss trade-offs (SQL vs NoSQL, hash collisions, cache eviction)
- Mention deployment, logging, and monitoring
