"""
N-Queens Problem Solver
---
- Goal: Place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other.
- Constraints: No two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal.

- Use backtracking to explore valid queen placements row by row.
- Track column and diagonal conflicts to prune invalid paths.
- Return all valid board configurations.
